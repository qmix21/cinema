Api Documentation

For all examples given, this server has been setup locally so i will be using localhost for the domain name. Just change localhost to your domain name if you have set this up on a server.

{Please note that i was unable to set up API as when i tried i kept getting 401 unauthorised on all my sites even when a user was logged in. So to counter any unauthorised actions i have only allowed GET requests as no-one is able to abuse any POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH reqeuests. Adding records will be done through artisan tinker or mysql until API Auth works.}



Routes:

CINEMA:
GET : http://localhost/api/cinemas

Doing the GET request above will get all Cinemas in the database. This route is calling the CinemasController@index function which paginates every 10 objects. it then runs that through CinemaResource::collection. This will sort the data into an array and return it.



GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/1 or http://localhost/api/cinema/Burwood

Where the '1' is you would substitute for a number to specifiy which cinema you would like to see the data of.
you can also use names, which you can find by running the GET request to get all cinemas. Both work fine.

GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/*name*/sessions
This GET request gets all sessions at the cinema *name*

GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/*name*/*movie*
This GET Request will get all sessions for *movie* at cinema *name*

GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/*name*/session/*time* or *date*
This GET request will get all sessions from cinema *name* that are playing at *time* or *date*





Movies:


GET : http://localhost/api/movies
This GET request will get all the movies in the database.


GET : http://localhost/api/movie/1
This GET Request will get the movies who's ID is 1, you can interchange 1 to any ID as long as it is in the database(run the GET request to get all movies if unsure)
