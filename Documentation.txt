Api Documentation

For all examples given, this server has been setup locally using apache2 so i will be using localhost for the domain name. Just change localhost to your domain name inside your httpd.conf if you have set this up on a server and ensure that the database details in .env is the same as your database.

I am in the progress of building a web application that utilises the API. (wasn't sure if this was needed or the api was only to be used via the URL), web application can be reach at http://localhost/, the web application will try and have all the below functions.

All POST requests will require a user to have registered using the http://localhost/api/register function and have them keep a copy of their access token as it will be needed.



Via URL:
Routes:

CINEMA:
GET : http://localhost/api/cinemas

Doing the GET request above will get all Cinemas in the database. This route is calling the CinemasController@index function which paginates every 10 objects. it then runs that through CinemaResource::collection. This will sort the data into an array and return it.



GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/1 or http://localhost/api/cinema/Burwood

Where the '1' is you would substitute for a number to specifiy which cinema you would like to see the data of.
you can also use names, which you can find by running the GET request to get all cinemas. Both work fine.

GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/*name*/sessions
This GET request gets all sessions at the cinema *name*

GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/*name*/*movie*
This GET Request will get all sessions for *movie* at cinema *name*

GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/*name*/sessions/*time* or *date*
This GET request will get all sessions from cinema *name* that are playing at *time* or *date*

This Get request will get the session at cinema for movie at the time or date





Movies:


GET : http://localhost/api/movies
This GET request will get all the movies in the database.


GET : http://localhost/api/movie/1
This GET Request will get the movies who's ID is 1, you can interchange 1 to any ID as long as it is in the database(run the GET request to get all movies if unsure)

This will return all sessions for the movie *name*
