Starting the Project.

Created models for each of the 3 classes (Cinema, Movies and Session_time);

Created a Seeder to input information into the tables for testing purposes.

Created Routing 
[
Route::get('/cinemas','CinemaController@index');
Route::get('/cinemas/{id}','CinemaController@show');
Route::get('/cinemas','CinemaController@store');
Route::put('/cinemas/{id}','CinemaController@update');
Route::delete('/cinemas/{id}','CinemaController@delete');
]

Created an API token table for authentication.

Need to create an Register page. (reading from toptal.com/laravel/restful-laravel-api-tutorial)
