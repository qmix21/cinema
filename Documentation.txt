Api Documentation

For all examples given, this server has been setup locally using apache2 so i will be using localhost for the domain name. Just change localhost to your domain name inside your httpd.conf if you have set this up on a server and ensure that the database details in .env is the same as your database.

I am in the progress of building a web application that utilises the API. (wasn't sure if this was needed or the api was only to be used via the URL), web application can be reach at http://localhost/, the web application will try and have all the below functions. You can hover over the buttons to show what api function it is runnning

All POST requests will require a user to have registered using the http://localhost/api/register function and have them keep a copy of their access token as it will be needed. The POST requests will also need to be done via POSTMAN



Note: Wasn't able to figure out how to shorten the time to 12:00 .....




Via URL:
Routes:

CINEMA:
GET : http://localhost/api/cinemas
Doing the GET request above will get all Cinemas in the database. This route is calling the CinemasController@index function which paginates every 10 objects. it then runs that through CinemaResource::collection. This will sort the data into an array and return it.
This also supports pages, 10 per page, you can go http://localhost/api/cinemas?page=X , where X is the number of pages

GET : http://localhost/api/cinema/1 or http://localhost/api/cinema/Burwood
Where the '1' is you would substitute for a number to specifiy which cinema you would like to see the data of.
you can also use names, which you can find by running the GET request to get all cinemas. Both work fine.
